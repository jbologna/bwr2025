# Quick Wiki Guide

## How to edit the wiki

1. Go to the **Wiki** tab in the class repository.
2. Click **New Page** to create a new page, or select an existing page and click **Edit**.
3. Add your content in markdown format (headings, bullet lists, links are supported).
4. At the bottom, describe your change in the **Commit message** box.
5. Click **Save Page**.

## Wiki rules

- Only edit your own sections unless asked to collaborate.
- Add your name or initials at the bottom of pages you create.
- Keep edits small and focused.
- Don’t delete other students’ work — if something is wrong, leave a comment instead.
